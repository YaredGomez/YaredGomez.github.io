		<h2>The history of C.D. Guadalajara</h2>
		<p>
			The full name of 'Chivas' is Club deportivo Guadalajara which translated means'sporting club Guadalajara'<br>
			CD Guadalajara was founded on the 8th of May in 1906 as club name 'Club Union' Chivas plays at Akron Stadium their home stadium.<br>
			Chivas was founded by Edgar Evaraert, a Belgian which is ironic if you think about Chivas being a Mexcan only club.<br>
			Edgar Evaraert borrowed the vertical stripes and colour scheme from a belgian club called Club Brugge K.V.<br>
			Chivas first started off playing with a mix of Mexican, Belgian and French players and the reason the club <br>
			was called Club Union was becasue of the fact that there was a mix of different nationalities.<br>
			until the Mexican people got angry because foreigners were being favored more at the time<br>
			Chivas changed to being a Mexcan only club to help the opression that was happening.<br>
